# Animations

Flutter animation samples.

Mostly widgets that mimic various animations I see on concept sites such as Dribbble.

## Carousel

Widget that takes in a list of children and animates them in a view pager like fashion. The exiting element 
will shrink and leave the screen while the next element grows and enters.
